<p>Computed state is derived using a Lodash inspired DSL - checkout the <a href="/docs/api/api.html">API section</a> for a complete listing</p>
<p>A few key concepts</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>root</strong> and everything derived from it is chainable</li>
<li>Everything is declarative, there is no data compile time - much like Lodash-FP or Ramda</li>
<li>Anything you derive but don't export from your model never happens</li>
<li>Nothing changes in place - you are defining a series of transformations, for example <strong>assign</strong> won't modify the input
  array it gets, it just generates a new object with the result</li>
<li><strong>call</strong> is your escape hatch - you can use it to do any transformation that is not part of the DSL, but treat the
  inputs as read only otherwise bugs will happen</li>
</ul>
